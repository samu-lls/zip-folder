# Zip Folder - Manual Soft Delete Script by @samu.lls
A project to zip a backup folder, scheduling backups by simulating a local "Soft Delete" on the computer, where you can schedule the execution of the file in Windows daily, weekly, monthly, and annually.  

  You need to have 7-zip installed and know the local folder where it is installed to include it in the code.
The command works in the BATCH language; if there is an accent in any word in the directory, it will not execute.
